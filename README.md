# **Supermarket Sales Data Analysis**

 This project focuses on analyzing supermarket sales data to uncover valuable insights and optimize sales strategies. The following steps were performed:

•	Data Preparation: The Supermarket Sales data was cleaned and imported using Excel and MS SQL. Data exploration was conducted using MS SQL queries to analyze sales 
  growth.
  
•	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Python was used to perform EDA on the dataset. Key purchasing patterns were discovered, including higher spending by females and 
  the impact of tax percentage on product sales.
  
•	Interactive Power BI Dashboard: An interactive Power BI dashboard was developed to visualize and present the analyzed data. DAX was utilized to calculate key 
  metrics, enabling a comprehensive view of the sales performance.
  
## **Key Insights:**

•	Based on the analysis, the following key insights were derived:

•	Sports and travel products yielded the most profits.

•	Weekday sales outperformed weekends.

## **Solution:**

•	To optimize sales and mitigate the effect of tax percentage on product sales, the proposed solution is to offer discounts and promotions across cities. By 
  implementing this strategy, supermarkets can potentially attract more customers and boost sales despite the impact of taxes.

## **Technologies Used:**

•	Excel: Utilized for data cleaning and initial data import.

•	MS SQL: Employed for data exploration and analysis using SQL queries.

•	Python: Used for conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization using libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib.

•	Power BI: Developed an interactive dashboard to visualize and present the analyzed data.

•	DAX: Utilized in Power BI to calculate key metrics and enable deeper insights.
